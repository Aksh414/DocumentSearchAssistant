*Solution*: Focus on implementing robust handling for a limited set of document types initially (PDF and DOCX). Use established libraries like PyPDF2 and python-docx.

### Challenge 2: Implementing Semantic Search Quickly
*Solution*: Leverage pre-trained embedding models like Sentence Transformers for document indexing rather than building custom semantic models.

### Challenge 3: Fast Summary Generation
*Solution*: Use prompt engineering with the LLM to generate concise summaries, potentially with chunking for large documents to manage token limits.

### Challenge 4: Time Constraints
*Solution*: Create a clear prioritization of features and focus on having a working demo of the core functionality rather than implementing all features fully.

### Challenge 5: Cost Management
*Solution*: Set up API call limits and caching strategies to minimize usage of paid AI services. Consider using smaller, open-source models where appropriate.

2. Backend processes document (extract text, metadata)
3. Text is split into chunks
4. Each chunk is embedded using an embedding model
5. Embeddings are stored in vector database
6. Document metadata is stored in regular database

### Search Workflow
1. User enters natural language query
2. Query is processed and embedded
3. Vector similarity search finds relevant chunks
4. Results are ranked and returned
5. User can request summary for specific documents
6. Summary is generated using LLM and displayed

## 12. Conclusion

This AI-Based Document Search & Retrieval Assistant has the potential to significantly improve knowledge workers' efficiency by reducing time spent searching for information. The hackathon prototype will focus on demonstrating the core capabilities with a limited document set, while establishing an architecture that could be expanded into a full product.

By prioritizing the semantic search functionality, document summarization, and a clean user interface, the system will showcase the power of AI-enhanced document interaction even within the tight 26-hour development constraint.
