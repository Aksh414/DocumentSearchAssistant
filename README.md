# Document Search Assistant

##  Problem
Searching information across multiple documents is time-consuming and inefficient, especially when users need relevant answers quickly. This project aims to build an AI-powered document search assistant that can retrieve and summarize relevant information from documents using natural language queries.


##  Approach
The system follows a simple AI/ML pipeline:
- Documents are ingested and preprocessed
- Text is converted into embeddings / searchable representations
- User queries are matched against documents
- Relevant content is retrieved and presented to the user

Technologies used include Python and NLP-based techniques for document processing and search.

##  Current Status & Limitations
### What works:
- Basic document ingestion and indexing
- Query-based document retrieval
- Initial search results generation

### Limitations:
- Search accuracy can vary based on document quality
- Limited evaluation metrics
- Scalability and optimization not fully addressed yet

##  What I Learned
Through this project, I learned:
- How real-world document search systems are structured
- Practical challenges in NLP-based information retrieval
- Importance of preprocessing and evaluation in ML pipelines
- How AI systems behave differently outside ideal datasets

---

##  Future Improvements
- Improve retrieval accuracy using better embeddings
- Add document summarization for retrieved results
- Optimize performance for large document sets
- Improve documentation and add usage examples
- Add evaluation metrics to measure search quality
